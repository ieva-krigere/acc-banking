# acc-banking
Study project for Accenture Java Bootcamp

This project was created as part of study activities in a Java Bootcamp organised by Accenture Baltics in Jan/Feb 2025.
The objective of the exercise is to practice OOP, encapsulation and other Java concepts.
The aim is to create a basic banking application and eventually link it to other student's work through a REST API developed with Spring Boot.
